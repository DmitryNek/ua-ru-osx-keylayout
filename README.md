# Ukrainian-Russian Keyboard Layout

Historically Ukrainian and Russian languages are phonetically very close differing only by a few letters so many Ukrainians communicate in Russian language as well. To leverage this fact I've created a keyboard which allows to enter Russian characters by pressing the ⌥  (Option) modifier: ⌥ + і then outputs ы etc

## Modifiers list
* ⌥ + і = ы
* ⌥ + ї = ъ
* ⌥ + є = э
* ⌥ + ґ = ё

## Curencies shortcuts
* ⌥ + и = ₴
* ⌥ + 4 = $
* ⌥ + ⇪ + и = ₽
* ⌥ + ⇪ + 3 = £
* ⌥ + ⇪ + 4 = €

## Installation

Move the keyboard layout `Ukraine.keylayout` and icons file `Ukraine.icns` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` directory. 

    git clone https://github.com/DmitryNek/ua-ru-osx-keylayout.git
    cd ua-ru-osx-keylayout/
    sudo cp Ukraine.{icns,keylayout} /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

Restart the computer.

Enable the new keyboard layout from System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources (press + and look for the "Others" section)

Reboot the computer once more to apply keyboard layout changes for all applications.

If you want to add own changes to keyboard layout, feel free to edit it. You can use any text editor or [Ukelele][0] keyboard layout tool.
