# Ukrainian-Russian Keyboard Layout

Historically Ukrainian and Russian languages are phonetically very close differing only by a few letters so many Ukrainians communicate in Russian language as well. To leverage this fact I've created a keyboard which allows to enter Russian characters by pressing the ⌥  (Option) modifier: ⌥ + і then outputs ы etc

## Full modifiers list
* ⌥ + і = ы
* ⌥ + ї = ъ
* ⌥ + є = э
* ⌥ + ґ = ё

## Installation

Move the keyboard layout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/. Keyboard layouts in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can't be selected in password dialogs or on the login window

Restart the computer. Logging out and back in is not enough

Enable the new keyboard layout from System Preferences (look for the "Others" section)

### Hope you will find this layout useful!
