# Ukrainian-Russian Keyaboard Layout

Historically Ukrainian and Russian languages are phonetically very close differing only by a few letters so many Ukrainians speak Russian language. To leverage this fact I've created a keyboard which allows to enter Russian characters by pressing the ⌥  (Option) modifier: ⌥ + і then outputs ы etc

## Full modifiers list
* ⌥ + і = ы
* ⌥ + ї = ъ
* ⌥ + є = э
* ⌥ + ґ = ё

Hope you will find this layout useful!
